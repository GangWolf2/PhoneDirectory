# PhoneDirectory
This program simulates a phone directory through the use of binary search trees. 
It has the capabilities to insert, delete, and search through the BST for certain contacts.

# Current Version
Currently, the program's insert and search functions work without errors, however the delete function is currently a work in progress
It causes segmentation faults on the deletion of certain contacts and I am currently debugging and testing to find the cause.
